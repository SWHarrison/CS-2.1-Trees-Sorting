1. Handle case of root node needing to split in insert rather than _insert_helper
2. Change eject in non-leaf nodes to not keep ejected value in one of two child nodes
3. Make sure to make new_node in ejections the "right" or larger node
  a. This is so that we can maintain the list structure at the leaf level
  b. Make new_node take current_node's next leaf
  c. Make current_node next_leaf point to the new_node
