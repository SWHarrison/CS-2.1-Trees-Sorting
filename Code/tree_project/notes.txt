1. Handle case of root node needing to split in insert rather than _insert_helper
2. Change eject in non-leaf nodes to not keep ejected value in one of two child nodes
3. Make sure to make new_node in ejections the "right" or larger node
  a. This is so that we can maintain the list structure at the leaf level
  b. Make new_node take current_node's next leaf
  c. Make current_node next_leaf point to the new_node

insert method seems to be working after making above changes. Consider changing
or refactoring code in insert due to similar code in handling ejections for both
leaf and non-leaf nodes

Time to work on contains!

Changed creation of new node when not at leaf level to ensure node is not leaf

Notes on deletion from B+ tree visualization site.
Only takes from "sibling" nodes aka same parent
Takes from left over right if both are available regardless of how many in each
if no siblings available to take then perform merge/rotation

Merge node observations:
Removes child node
